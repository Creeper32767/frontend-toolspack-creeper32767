## üöÄ Included Tools

This repository contains a homepage that links to three distinct web applications:

### 1. Fluent Code Editor

A versatile and responsive online code editor. Perfect for quick edits, learning, and sharing code snippets.

*   **Syntax Highlighting:** Support for JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, C++, Java, and more.
*   **Theme Switching:** Instantly switch between light (Default) and dark (Dracula) themes.
*   **File Operations:** Upload local files and download your work.
*   **Responsive Design:** Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 2. Professional Reader Card Generator

Create and share beautifully designed quote cards from your favorite books.

*   **Rich Customization:** Choose from a selection of elegant Chinese fonts for titles and body text.
*   **Personal Touch:** Upload your own photo to be included on the card.
*   **HD Export:** Generate a high-resolution PNG image of your final card, perfect for sharing on social media.
*   **Pre-designed Templates:** Use the "Random Example" button to quickly see a professionally designed layout.

### 3. Web Screenshot Generator

A powerful tool to capture full-page screenshots of any website.

*   **Full-Page Capture:** Renders the entire webpage, no matter how long, into a single PNG image.
*   **Interactive Preview:** Load the target website in an iframe, scroll, click, and interact with it to get the perfect shot before capturing.
*   **Client-Side Security:** All operations happen in your browser. Your session data (cookies, logins) is used to load the page but is never sent to a server.
*   **Live Progress Bar:** See the rendering progress in real-time when generating complex pages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **UI Framework:** [Microsoft Fluent UI Web Components](https://www.fast.design/docs/components/getting-started/) for a modern, clean interface.
*   **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, Modern JavaScript (ES6+).
*   **Key Libraries:**
    *   [CodeMirror.js](https://codemirror.net/): Powers the code editor.
    *   [html2canvas.js](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/): Used for generating images from DOM elements in the card and screenshot tools.
